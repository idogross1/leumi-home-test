# Leumi Bank home test

In this project I fetched data about the weather in different cities, from https://openweathermap.org/ api.
The script finds for each day the city with the heighst temprature and the city with the lowest temprature.
The script writes the results into a csv file.

I used nodejs to write the project and used node modules such as axios, fs and dotenv.

To run the project you will need to have an api key set in .env file and than run "npm start".
